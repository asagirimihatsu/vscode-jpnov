/**
 * Pure planning half of the rename tracking (import-style reference updates): given the
 * renames of one `onDidRenameFiles` event, compute the exact line edits each `.jpbook`
 * needs so its chapter paths keep pointing at the moved files. vscode-free — the event
 * wiring, the prompt, and the `WorkspaceEdit` live in `tracking.ts`; everything here is
 * unit-testable with plain paths.
 *
 * All paths are ABSOLUTE, POSIX-normalized fs paths (the caller normalizes `Uri.fsPath`).
 * A rename matches an entry either exactly (a file rename) or as a directory prefix (a
 * folder rename moves everything under it). Entries are relative to the book's OWNING
 * WORKSPACE FOLDER root — so moving a `.jpbook` itself never needs an update, and only a
 * target leaving the workspace folder is unrepresentable (reported, never rewritten into
 * a broken path).
