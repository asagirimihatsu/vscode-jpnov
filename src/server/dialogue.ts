/**
 * The dialogue stack: where an utterance 「…」／『…』 starts and ends. One rule, read by the lint
 * walker and the highlighter alike, so that a character can never be dialogue to one and
 * 地の文 to the other.
 *
 * Only prose (`text` nodes) feeds the stack: ［＃「対象」に傍点］ carries its 「対象」 inside an
 * annotation node, and a 「 swallowed by an unclosed ［＃ sits in a brokenAnnotation, so neither
 * can open an utterance (the Aozora trap). An opener always pushes; a closer pops only when it
 * matches the top; a mismatched closer is ordinary prose. The stack is document-scoped: an
 * utterance may span lines.
 *
 * Offsets are UTF-16 units, as `TextDocument.positionAt` counts them.
